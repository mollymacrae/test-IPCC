# Adding figure data to the GitHub repository

This is a step-by-step guide to uploading your figure data to the IPCC AR7 GitHub repository.

1. [Create a directory for your data](https://github.com/mollymacrae/test-IPCC/tree/main/Chapter1#create-a-directory-for-your-data)

2. [Filling out the readme.txt file for your figure data from template](https://github.com/mollymacrae/test-IPCC/tree/main/Chapter1#fill-out-the-readmetxt-for-your-figure-data)
   
3. [Upload your figure data](https://github.com/mollymacrae/test-IPCC/tree/main/Chapter1#upload-your-figure-data)

## Create a directory for your data
To add figure data, first create a folder with name e.g. ch1_fig3 by clicking 'Add file' > 'Create new file'. 
Name your file **ch-_fig-/Readme.txt** (replacing '-' with the chapter and figure number, e.g. ch1_fig3/Readme.txt). This will create a directory for your figure and a Readme.txt file in the directory.

Click 'Commit changes' then 'Commit changes' again when a box appears.

You should now have a folder for your chapter figure.

## Upload your figure data to the directory

To add data to this folder, click 'Add file' > 'Upload files' and upload your data.
