# Adding figure data to the GitHub repository

This is a step-by-step guide to uploading your figure data to the IPCC AR7 GitHub repository.

1. [Create a directory for your data](https://github.com/mollymacrae/test-IPCC/edit/main/Chapter1/README.md#create-a-directory-for-your-data)

2. [Filling out the readme.txt file for your figure data](https://github.com/mollymacrae/test-IPCC/edit/main/Chapter1/README.md#fill-out-the-readmetxt-for-your-figure-data)
   
3. [Upload your figure data](https://github.com/mollymacrae/test-IPCC/edit/main/Chapter1/README.md#upload-your-figure-data)

## Create a directory for your data
To add figure data, first create a folder with name **ch1_fig<number>** (e.g. ch1_fig3) by clicking 'Add file' > 'Create new file'.

Name your file **ch1_fig<number>/Readme.txt**. This will create a directory for your figure and a Readme.txt file in the directory.



Click 'Commit changes' then 'Commit changes' again when a box appears.
